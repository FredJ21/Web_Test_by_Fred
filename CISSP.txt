Risk assessment
	1. Cataloging assets and capabilities (resources) in a system.
	2. Assigning quantifiable value (or at least rank order) and importance to those resources
	3. Identifying the vulnerabilities or potential threats to each resource
	4. Mitigating or eliminating the most serious vulnerabilities for the most valuable resources
Vulnerability assessment
	Quantitative
	Qualitative
	Defining critical support areas
